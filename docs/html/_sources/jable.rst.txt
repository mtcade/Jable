Test of ``PyJable.jable.JFrame()``:

The JFrame is a simple, unassuming representation of the Json Table (jable) has rows as numbers, columns as strings. There are two reasons to use it over .csv:

    1. It can encode anything serializable to Json as an item in a cell, with support for custom encoders and decoders
    2. It can save space by not repeating the same values over and over
    
Otherwise, it does not offer many powers other tabular data do not.
