Jable
========

Jable is a simple too for serializing simple tabular data for casual use on the disk, as an improvement to the .csv format.

The `JyFrame` is a simple, unassuming representation of the Json Table (jable). Acess and set data with simple bracket notation, `jyFrame[ row(s), column(s) ]`.
It has rows as numbers, columns as strings. There are two situations to use it over .csv:

    1. It can encode anything serializable to Json as an item in a cell, with support for custom encoders and decoders
    2. It can save space by not repeating the same values over and over
    
Otherwise, it does not offer many powers other tabular data do not. Use it for small, on disk data, not database or big data applications.
